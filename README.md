# Java_simple_projects
In this repository, I created many simple java applications. Each application is focused on a specific java concept. 
I also tested each application, and the test.java for each application is under the Test_Files. 
Temps.java is a very basic application that let the user convert Temperature from a different unit. 
For example Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. 
CircleArea.java is focused on the concept of loops and if/else statements, using Scanner, and some preconditions. 
Calculation.java is used by CircleArea.java. Pizza class showcases the formal way to create class with java.
It has Constants, enumeration, private instances, Constructors, Accessors, Mutators, and toString method.
